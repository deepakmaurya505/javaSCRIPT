java Script is a:-
1.
 Synchronus lang
(Synchronus lang:- ek code execute hoga uske baad ek code execute hoga uske baad ek)

2.
single Threaded lang
(therefore slow execution in comparison to others but we can't feel it)

the above both are default javascript behaviour

->Execution context
            |-> execute one line of code at a time

          E |->console log->2         // to complete before executing
